**Sutra**
**## Your companion for path to meet your true self**

This project aims to create a holistic app for practicing yoga postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation. It will cater to users of all levels, from beginners to experienced practitioners.

**## Technologies**

**Backend:**

* Python (Django): Primary backend framework for server-side logic, API development, and database interactions.
* Node.js (Optional): Potential future consideration for specific backend needs that may be better suited for Node.js. The decision on which framework (e.g., Express.js, NestJS) to use will be made based on those requirements.

**Frontend:**

* React JS: Single-page application (SPA) framework for building the responsive web interface accessible on all major devices (desktops, laptops, tablets).
* Flutter: Cross-platform framework for developing native mobile applications for Android and iOS devices.

**Databases:**

* PostgreSQL: Primary relational database for structured data like user profiles, yoga practices, and progress tracking.
* MongoDB (Optional): Potential future consideration for flexible data structures like user preferences or meditation experiences, depending on project requirements.

**Version Control:**

* GitHub: Primary platform for public code sharing, collaboration, version tracking, and issue management.
* Vashishtha Enterprise's Parivartan (Optional): In-house version control system for internal tracking and management.

**Instructions (High-Level Outline):**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<project-name>.git
   ```
2. **Set up the backend environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment.
   - Activate the virtual environment.
   - Install required Python libraries (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and configure Django settings with connection details.
3. **Set up the React frontend:**
   - Navigate to the frontend directory (e.g., `frontend`).
   - Install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
   - Run the development server (`npm start` or `yarn start`).
4. **Set up the Flutter mobile app (if applicable):**
   - Open the project in a code editor compatible with Flutter.
   - Configure the project for Android and/or iOS development as needed.
   - Run the app simulator or connect a physical device.
